# Wiv-DesignThinking
The result of the 3 weeks project "Design Thinking", organised by Patrick Maruejouls with the help of Guewen Loussouarn.

Wiv is a platform meant to facilitate micro-formations and meetings between colleagues and it has been thought, designed and made (only a partial demo for now) with the contribution of Anthony Putzolu (42), Fannie Desprez-Cur√©ly (Strate), Claire Di Felici, Eliza Robinet-Duffo and Hugues Borel (HEC).

You can find the presentation of Wiv at the following site: http://wiv-designthinking.herokuapp.com/.
